## Feasibility

  * This prompt uses python for more complex and convenient programming than shell,
    therefore process startup cost is higher. Prompt execution takes usually
    120ms to 340ms depending computer. Usually there in no need to enter
    commands under 500ms, but not having immediate (< 100ms) response gives
    a bit sluggish feeling.
  * Color scheme works best on gray-a-like terminal background.


## Install Instructions

### Antigen

Add `antigen bundle hevi9/infoline-zsh-theme` to your `.zshrc` file. [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you start zsh. You can also add the plugin to a running zsh with `antigen bundle hevi9/infoline-zsh-theme` for testing before adding it to your `.zshrc`.

### Installing to use directly in `.zshrc` without a Framework

  * `make install` instead of `make install-omz`
  * Edit infoline.zsh-theme contents into your `.zshrc`

### Oh-My-Zsh

Install theme as symlink to oh my zsh $ZSH/themes
```shell
> cd ~/src   # or wherever you like to collect local git repositories
> git clone https://github.com/hevi9/infoline-zsh-theme.git
> cd infoline-zsh-theme
> make install-omz
```

### Zgen

Add `zgen load hevi9/infoline-zsh-theme` to your `.zshrc` file in the same function you're doing your other `zgen load` calls in. [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) will automatically clone the repository for you when you do a `zgen save`.

## Requirements
  * 256 color and unicode terminal
  * zsh as your login shell
  * [oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) or another zsh framework that is oh-my-zsh compatible like [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) or [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen).
  * Python 3.4+, pip and dependencies via pip install:
    * psutils
    * gitpython

## Notes
  * Set export DEBUG_PROMPT=1 to show debug log on prompt construction
  * Set export VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=yes
