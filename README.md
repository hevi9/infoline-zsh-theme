## Install

### Antigen

Add `antigen bundle hevi9/infoline-zsh-theme` to your .zshrc file. [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you start zsh. You can also add the plugin to a running zsh with `antigen bundle hevi9/infoline-zsh-theme` for testing before adding it to your `.zshrc`.

### oh-my-zsh

Install theme as symlink to $ZSH/themes
```shell
> cd ~/src   # or wherever you like to collect local git repositories
> git clone https://github.com/hevi9/infoline-zsh-theme.git
> cd infoline-zsh-theme
> make install
```

### zgen

Add `zgen load hevi9/infoline-zsh-theme` to your .zshrc file in the same function you're doing your other `zgen load` calls in. [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) will automatically clone the repository for you when you do a `zgen save`.
