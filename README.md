## Install Instructions

### Antigen

Add `antigen bundle hevi9/infoline-zsh-theme` to your `.zshrc` file. [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you start zsh. You can also add the plugin to a running zsh with `antigen bundle hevi9/infoline-zsh-theme` for testing before adding it to your `.zshrc`.

### Installing to use directly in `.zshrc` without a Framework

  * `make install` instead of `make install-omz`
  * Edit infoline.zsh-theme contents into your `.zshrc`

### Oh-My-Zsh

Install theme as symlink to oh my zsh $ZSH/themes
```shell
> cd ~/src   # or wherever you like to collect local git repositories
> git clone https://github.com/hevi9/infoline-zsh-theme.git
> cd infoline-zsh-theme
> make install-omz
```

### Zgen

Add `zgen load hevi9/infoline-zsh-theme` to your `.zshrc` file in the same function you're doing your other `zgen load` calls in. [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) will automatically clone the repository for you when you do a `zgen save`.

## Requirements
  * 256 color and unicode terminal
  * zsh as your login shell
  * [oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) or another zsh framework that is oh-my-zsh compatible like [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) or [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen).
  * Python 3.4+, pip and dependencies via pip install:
    * psutils
    * gitpython

## Notes
 * This prompt uses python for more complex and convient programmnig than shell,
   therefore process startup cost is higher. Prompt execution takes usually
   130ms.
 * Set export VIRTUAL_ENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=yes
 * Set export DEBUG_PROMPT=1 to show debug log on prompt making

## Todos
 * bash support, after bash unicode and non-printable wrap issues are resolved
 * git detached head
 * git conflicted files
 * git stashes
 * Sign for virtual env
 * todos in current directory info
